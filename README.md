# Projectile Motion Simulation in Python

This repository presents a Python project focused on simulating projectile motion. The goal is to implement numerical integration methods for solving the equations governing the kinematics of projectiles, as encountered in introductory physics courses. 

# ODE Numerical Methods

It includes different numerical methods such as:

- Euler's Method
- Runge-Kutta Method (coming soon)
- Adams-Bashforth Method (coming soon)

This project is handy to explore the fundamentals of projectile motion through this computational implementation; I also tried to use good code practices and software design principles.
