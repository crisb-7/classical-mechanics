# Projectile Motion Simulation in Python

This repository presents a Python project focused on simulating projectile motion. The goal is to implement numerical integration methods for solving the equations governing the kinematics of projectiles, as encountered in introductory physics courses. It includes different integration methods such as:

- Euler's Method
- Runge-Kutta Method (coming soon)
- Adams-Bashforth Method (coming soon)

This project is handy to explore the fundamentals of projectile motion through this computational implementation; I also tried to use good code practices and software design principles. 

It is meant as an educational resource only, and you should not copy/replicate any part of this code if you're currently developing a project for a university physics course.
