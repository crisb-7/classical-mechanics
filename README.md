# Classical Mechanics Simulations in Python

This repository presents a Python project focused on classical mechanics simulations. The goal is to implement numerical integration methods for solving the equations governing the laws of motion, as encountered in introductory physics courses. 

## Simulations

The project supports various examples of basic simulations based on classical mechanics principles, including:

- [x] Projectile Motion (2D)
- [ ] Pendulum
    - [ ] Simple
    - [ ] Damped
    - [ ] Dobule Pendulum
- [ ] Generalize Central Force
- [ ] Spring
    - [ ] Simple
    - [ ] Damped

## ODE Numerical Methods

It includes different numerical methods such as:

- [x] Euler's Method
- [ ] Euler-Cromer Method
- [ ] Verlet's Velocity Method
- [ ] Runge-Kutta 4 Method
- [ ] Adams-Bashforth Method

## To-do list

- [x] Euler Method class
- [x] 1D projectile motion simulation
- [x] Modularize ODE solver
- [x] 2D projectile motion simulation
- [x] Migrate to Classical Mechanics project
    - [x] Rename repo
    - [x] Change git origin url
    - [x] Segregate simulation cases
    - [x] Create simulation interface (Simulation class)

- [x] Create Packages
- [ ] Proper git development
    - [ ] Protect main branch
    - [ ] Setup for PR development

Eventually these will become pull requests, after the previous checklist is fulfilled 

- [ ] Visualization Package
- [ ] Dataclasses for units?
- [ ] Benchmark Simulation + ODE solver performance
    - [ ] Native Python vs NumPy vs NumPy + Numba
    - [ ] Pre-allocated arrays? Arrays at all??
    - [ ] Generator execution?

- [ ] Numerical error analysis
- [ ] Generalized coordinates implementation?

## Academic Integrity Disclaimer

The primary purpose of this project is to enhance your understanding of physics through hands-on code. You probably already know what plagiarism is, and that you shouldn't do it. Nevertheless, do not copy or replicate any part of the code or substantial portions of it without proper citation, and try to maintain academic integrity. Remember, the goal is to learn and understand physics principles, not to circumvent the learning process.
